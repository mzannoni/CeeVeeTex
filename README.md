## CeeVeeTex
Template to create a Curriculum Vitae. There is also a template for a cover/motivation letter.  

### Content details
Actually, 3 templates are presented.  
* The main and somehow graphically better is [`CeeVeeTex.tex`](./CeeVeeTex.tex).  
  * One version of this first template that includes links to web content pages, embedded in logos, is [`CeeVeeTex_w_links.tex`](./CeeVeeTex_w_links.tex).  
* Then, there is a simplified version, called [`CeeVeeTex_simple.tex`](./CeeVeeTex_simple.tex).  
This latter one is derived from the first, which has been created more or less from scratch.  
* Moreover, a CV based on the _europecv_ class is present. This is somehow a standard in Europe, and the document class is well implemented and documented in texlive (the package I've use to create these Latex documents).  

### Bonus
As a real example of CV, I included the `.tex` and the relative `.pdf` output of my currently up-to-date CV (most of the personal details have been stripped). It's called [`mz_CeeVeeTex_noinfo.tex`](./mz_CeeVeeTex_noinfo.tex).  

### Notes
The Latex source file are not yet clean from warnings (mainly, underfull/overfull badnesses). Any help/comment/tip on how to correct them, or in general on how to improve this repository are gladly welcome.
