## CeeVeeTex
Template to create a Curriculum Vitae. There is also a template for a cover/motivation letter.

### Content details
Actually, 3 templates are presented.
The main and somehow graphically better is CeeVeeTex.tex.
Then, there is a simplified version of this, called CeeVeeTex_simple.tex.
This latter one is derived from the first, which has been created more or less from scratch.
Moreover, a CV based on the europecv class is present. This is somehow a standard in Europe, and the document class is well implemented and documented in texlive (the package I've use to create these Latex documents), so I don't think it's necessary to document it to much.

### Bonus
As a real example of CV, I included the .tex and the relative .pdf output of the CV I've used in my latest interview (I've stripped most of the personal details, though). It's called mz_CeeVeeTex_noinfo.tex

### Notes
The Latex source file are not clean from warnings (mainly, underfull/overfull badnesses). Any help/comment/tip on how to correct them, or in general on how to improve this repository are gladly welcome.

Created with Texlive in Ubuntu 16.04.
